Additional File 4 - QTL mapping data and scripts

The file QTL_mapping.org contains a complete set of R scripts for the
QTL analysis of family 4 of the JAMA x PAXB cross and the fine mapping
analysis on chromosome 4 using individuals from multiple families. The
file is best viewed in Emacs org-mode but can be opened in any text
editor. There is also a QTL_mapping.html file, which contains the same
code and is formatted for viewing in the browser.
